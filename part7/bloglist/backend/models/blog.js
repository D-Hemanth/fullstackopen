// to remove unique id field _id & mongo versioning field __v from the frontend output
// One way to format the objects returned by Mongoose is to modify the toJSON method of the schema
// for get route When the response is sent in the JSON format, the toJSON method of each object in the array is called automatically by the JSON.stringify method
// toJSON is responsible to define what data will be serialized(taken as input) to convert to json format

// public interface of the module is defined by setting a value to the module.exports variable here we have set the value to be the Blog model
